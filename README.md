# SpamDetectionSMS-NLP-NaiveBayes
In this project we will be combining machine learning techniques with text, and using math and statistics to get that text in a format that the machine learning algorithms can understand!

We'll be using a dataset from the UCI datasets! The datasets contains a collection of more than 5 thousand SMS phone messages.

NLP libraries and Naive Bayes classifier will be used.
